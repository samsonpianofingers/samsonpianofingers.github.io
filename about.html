        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm a odd and motivated individual who enjoys learning about the world around me. I've spent some time exploring computer architecture (mostly intel x86), programming and software design and am quite interested in getting a career path in the IT Industry. Like most people, I have no clue as to what i really want to do. (yet.)</p>
        <p>I've also spent some time learning Piano (a lot of time), and, in my personal opinion have come to be at an intermediate level. I have skills in music theory, but not as much as I would like, and its going to be a long journey to learn it properly. You can find my music and other things at:
