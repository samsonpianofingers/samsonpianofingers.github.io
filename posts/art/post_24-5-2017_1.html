        <h2>Making Art with Code</h2>
        <p>On my projects page you can see that I've got a project written in java called java_gol.
        This project started as a simple conway's game of life simulator, and became a somewhat generalized automata simulator<br>
        Here is a screenshot:

        <p>In this screenshot you can see many patterns taking place, (this was a psuedo-randomly generated rule).</p>
        <p>I like to play around with this, and recenty I created a really nice pattern. I lost the original screenshot however.</p>
        <p>I do however have a vectorised version, and I did it using InkScape. A wonderful piece of free software.</p>
        <a class = "link" href = "https://inkscape.org">InkScape</a>
        <p>I used the "Trace Bitmap" feature, which uses different algorithms such as edge tracing to create vectors</p>
        <p>Here it is - Click for High-resolution image:</p>

        <p>So many patterns :)</p>
